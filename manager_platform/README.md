# eSports Manager Simulator 2023

You play as an org owner of an eSports team, and you handle everything from the budget to the training to the scouting to the coaching of your org.

At least in the early days.

### Hire Players

A team can't function without talent -- Scout from a list of generated players hungry for success, and eager to get started training and playing together from day 1.

- Use your players to earn your org money from sponsorships, streaming revenue, and merch sales.
  - The more popular your players get, the more they'll make you (and the more you'll have to pay them to keep 'em around)

### Play matches

### Train your team

### Own multiple teams

### Manage your budget

### Take over the eSports scene
